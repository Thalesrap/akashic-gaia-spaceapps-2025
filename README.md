# 🌍 Akashic Gaia
**When Earth looks at herself, humanity awakens.**  
*A project by Team System Breakdown for NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025*

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
Akashic Gaia is a poetic, scientific, and artistic experience built upon 25 years of NASA’s Terra satellite data.  
Our mission is to transform open data — vegetation, temperature, pollution, and fire activity — into a **Cartography of Collapse**: a living map of Earth’s memory.

By merging data science, artificial intelligence, and storytelling, Akashic Gaia reveals invisible planetary patterns and makes them emotionally accessible.  
It demonstrates that collaboration between humans and AIs can generate not just information, but wisdom.

## 🔧 Tools & Data
**NASA Data (references):**
- MODIS (NDVI, Land Surface Temperature) — sample images via Worldview Snapshots.
- MOPITT (Carbon Monoxide) — pollution indicators.
- CERES (Cloud and Earth Radiation) — energy budgets.
- VIIRS (Active Fire) — hotspot detection.

**AI & Tools used:**
- Google Gemini — generated artistic overlays (images are labeled as AI-generated).  
- Nova (GPT-5) — narrative design and strategic writing.  
- Replit — runtime, script execution and temporary hosting.  
- Pillow (PIL) — image processing (used in `scripts/generate_frames.py`).  
- ElevenLabs (TTS) — narration used in the demo video.

## 🌌 Proof of Execution (Prova de Execução)
This project was executed successfully on **Replit** as part of the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025. The automated workflow cloned this GitHub repository, installed dependencies, executed the image-generation script, and produced demonstrable outputs.

**Execution summary:**
- Repository cloned from GitHub.
- Dependencies installed (Pillow and Flask for the temporary web interface).
- Script executed: `/scripts/generate_frames.py`
- Frames generated:  
  - `/outputs/frame_001.png`  
  - `/outputs/frame_002.png`
- A small Flask app was created by Replit to preview and download the frames (optional public URL provided by Replit).

**Quick links to outputs:**
