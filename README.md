# 🌍 Akashic Gaia
**When Earth looks at herself, humanity awakens.**  
*A project by Team System Breakdown for NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025*

## 🚀 Project Overview
Akashic Gaia is a poetic, scientific, and artistic experience built upon 25 years of NASA’s Terra satellite data.  
Our mission is to transform open data — vegetation, temperature, pollution, and fire activity — into a **Cartography of Collapse**: a living map of Earth’s memory.  

By merging data science, artificial intelligence, and storytelling, Akashic Gaia reveals invisible planetary patterns and makes them emotionally accessible.  
It demonstrates that collaboration between humans and AIs can generate not just information, but wisdom.
