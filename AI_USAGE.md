# AI Usage and Acknowledgements

This project used artificial intelligence tools during design and production:

- **Google Gemini** — generated artistic overlays and symbolic imagery.  
  - All images included in `/assets/images` are watermarked: "AI-generated (Google Gemini)".
- **Nova (GPT-5)** — assisted with narrative design, copywriting, and project strategy.  
- **ElevenLabs (TTS)** — produced the narration audio used in the demo video.  
- **Replit** — code host and runtime for the prototype.  

### Where AI was used:
- **Visuals**: Gemini-generated images were used as overlays and have visible watermark.  
- **Audio**: TTS narration created with ElevenLabs and indicated in metadata.  
- **Code & Data**: Orchestration and scripting assisted by Nova prompts; all code/artifacts are in `/scripts`.

We confirm all AI-generated content is documented and labeled, and no proprietary NASA imagery or branding (logos, flags) were modified.
